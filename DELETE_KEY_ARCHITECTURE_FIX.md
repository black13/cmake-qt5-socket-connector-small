# Delete Key Architecture Fix - Complete Implementation

## Problem Statement
The original delete key handling violated Qt's event system and object-oriented principles:
- Window intercepted delete keys and routed to Scene
- Scene looped through selectedItems() trying to determine types
- External objects managed other objects' deletion
- Used problematic `qgraphicsitem_cast` and type checking

## Solution: Proper Qt Architecture
Implemented proper Qt event routing where each QGraphicsItem handles its own deletion.

## Files Modified

### Core Classes - Added keyPressEvent + Focus Management

**Edge Class (`edge.h` + `edge.cpp`):**
- Added `keyPressEvent()` override
- Added `ItemIsFocusable` flag
- Added focus handling in `itemChange()` when selected
- Edge handles own deletion via `scene->deleteEdge(getId())`

**Node Class (`node.h` + `node.cpp`):**
- Added `keyPressEvent()` override  
- Added `ItemIsFocusable` flag
- Added focus handling in existing `itemChange()` when selected
- Node handles own deletion via `scene->deleteNode(getId())`

**Socket Class (`socket.h` + `socket.cpp`):**
- Added `keyPressEvent()` override
- Added `itemChange()` method for selection/focus handling
- Added `ItemIsFocusable` flag
- Socket disconnects connected edge when deleted

### Architectural Cleanup

**Scene Class (`scene.h` + `scene.cpp`):**
- **REMOVED**: `deleteSelected()` method entirely (80+ lines deleted)
- **REASON**: Violated Qt event system and OOP principles

**Window Class (`window.cpp`):**
- **REMOVED**: Delete key interception from `keyPressEvent()`
- **REASON**: Events should go directly to focused items

### Documentation

**RULES.md:**
- Created development rules for proper Qt architecture
- Explicit guidelines against external deletion management
- Code review standards to prevent regressions

## New Event Flow

### Before (Broken):
```
User presses Delete → Window::keyPressEvent() → Scene::deleteSelected() 
→ Loop through selectedItems() → Type checking → External deletion
```

### After (Proper Qt):
```
User presses Delete → Selected Item::keyPressEvent() → Self-deletion
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Focus Management
When any item becomes selected:
```cpp
if (willBeSelected) {
    setFocus(Qt::MouseFocusReason);
    qDebug() << "Item: Taking keyboard focus for delete key handling";
}
```

### Self-Deletion Pattern
Each item handles its own delete key:
```cpp
void Item::keyPressEvent(QKeyEvent *event) {
    if (event->key() == Qt::Key_Delete || event->key() == Qt::Key_Backspace) {
        Scene* scene = qobject_cast<Scene*>(this->scene());
        if (scene) {
            scene->deleteItem(getId()); // Proper cleanup method
        }
        return;
    }
    QGraphicsItem::keyPressEvent(event); // Pass unhandled keys to parent
}
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Proper Qt Architecture**: Events route directly to focused items
2. **Object-Oriented Design**: Items manage their own lifecycle
3. **Eliminated Type Checking**: No loops, casts, or type identification needed
4. **Extensible**: New item types require no Scene modifications
5. **Clean Code**: Removed 80+ lines of problematic code
6. **Performance**: Direct event handling vs expensive loops

## Testing Results

- ✅ Edge selection + Delete key = Edge deletes properly
- ✅ Node selection + Delete key = Node deletes properly  
- ✅ Socket selection + Delete key = Disconnects connected edge
- ✅ No external loops or type checking required
- ✅ Proper Qt event propagation maintained

This fix represents a fundamental architectural improvement that makes the codebase more maintainable, performant, and aligned with Qt best practices.

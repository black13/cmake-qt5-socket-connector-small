NodeGraph
=========

Typed, Qt-based node/edge graph editor with a C++ facade and planned JavaScript integration. The current focus is eliminating qgraphicsitem_cast usage and consolidating working docs into a single plan file.

Quick Links
- Development plan and session resume: `PLAN.MD`
- Build (Linux/WSL): `mkdir -p build_linux && cd build_linux && cmake .. && make -j`
- Build (Windows): Generate with CMake and build in Visual Studio
- Run: `./NodeGraph`
- Concatenate sources for review: `bash concat.sh` (outputs `concatenated_code.txt`)

Status
- Active branch: docs consolidation and Branch 1.5 groundwork (Ghost Edge Typed Access).
- See `PLAN.MD` for up-to-date tasks and checklists.

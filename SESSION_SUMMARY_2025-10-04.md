# Session Summary - October 4, 2025

## Current Status

**Branch**: `main` (just switched from `feat/graph-rearch-01`)
**Last Commit**: `e77bcfd` - Fix node deletion bug: socket selection and UUID metadata issues

## Critical Fixes Completed

### 1. Socket Selection Bug ✅
**File**: `socket.cpp:27`
**Problem**: Sockets were `ItemIsSelectable=true`, stealing clicks from parent nodes
**Fix**: Changed to `ItemIsSelectable=false`
**Impact**: Only nodes and edges should be selectable, not child sockets

### 2. UUID Metadata Mismatch Bug ✅
**Files**: `node.cpp:481`, `edge.cpp:362`
**Problem**:
- Constructor creates object with random UUID, sets metadata
- XML `read()` method overwrites `m_id` but doesn't update metadata
- Scene registers with XML UUID, but metadata has old UUID
- Delete operation looks up by metadata UUID → FAILS

**Example**:
```
Constructor: m_id = "eeb6a66e", metadata = "eeb6a66e"
read():      m_id = "653dd6bb", metadata STILL "eeb6a66e" ❌
Scene:       registered with "653dd6bb"
Delete:      lookup with "eeb6a66e" → NOT FOUND
```

**Fix**: Added metadata update when UUID changes during XML read:
```cpp
// node.cpp:481 and edge.cpp:362
m_id = QUuid(QString::fromUtf8((char*)idStr));
// ✅ CRITICAL: Update metadata when UUID changes from XML
setData(Gik::UuidKey, m_id.toString(QUuid::WithoutBraces));
```

**Impact**: Node and edge deletion now work correctly

## Session Work Completed

### 1. Complete Graph Script Execution ✅
- Created `scripts/example_complete_graph.js` - 268 lines
- Script creates all 5 node types (SOURCE, SINK, TRANSFORM, SPLIT, MERGE)
- Topology: Diamond pattern with 6 nodes, 6 edges, 12 sockets all connected
- Successfully executed and saved to `complete_graph.xml`
- User manually repositioned nodes and saved as `complete_graph1.xml`

### 2. Scripting Documentation ✅
Created comprehensive documentation:
- `SCRIPTING_CAPABILITIES.md` - Full JavaScript API capabilities
- `COMPLETE_GRAPH_EXECUTION_RESULTS.md` - Execution results and validation
- `RUN_COMPLETE_GRAPH.md` - How to run scripts
- `BUILD_AND_RUN.md` - Build and execution guide

### 3. Bug Investigation and Fix ✅
- User reported nodes not deleting (edges worked fine)
- Investigated logs, found UUID mismatch issue
- Searched for pattern in all files (node.cpp, edge.cpp, socket.cpp)
- Fixed socket selection and UUID metadata issues
- Committed fix: `e77bcfd`

## Git Status

### Current Branch: main
Just checked out from `feat/graph-rearch-01`

### Pending Merge
**Need to merge**: `feat/graph-rearch-01` into `main` and push to remote

Branch `feat/graph-rearch-01` is ahead of origin by 5 commits:
1. Earlier commits (scripting system, complete graph example)
2. `e77bcfd` - Fix node deletion bug (LATEST)

### Stashed Changes
- `concatenated_code.txt` (auto-generated, stashed before checkout)

## Next Steps (User Requested)

1. ✅ Switch to main branch (DONE)
2. ⏳ Merge `feat/graph-rearch-01` into main
3. ⏳ Push main branch to remote
4. ⏳ Keep branches (don't delete)

## Files Modified in Last Session

### Core Bug Fixes:
- `socket.cpp` - Socket selection disabled
- `node.cpp` - UUID metadata update in read()
- `edge.cpp` - UUID metadata update in read()

### Documentation Created:
- `SCRIPTING_CAPABILITIES.md`
- `COMPLETE_GRAPH_EXECUTION_RESULTS.md`
- `RUN_COMPLETE_GRAPH.md`
- `BUILD_AND_RUN.md`

### Scripts Created:
- `scripts/example_complete_graph.js`
- `run_complete_graph.sh` (WSL)
- `run_complete_graph.ps1` (PowerShell)
- `run_complete_graph.bat` (Windows)

## Build Status

### Windows Build
- Visual Studio solution in root directory
- Builds successfully with fixes

### WSL/Linux Build
- Built successfully with `./build.sh debug clean`
- Executable: `build_linux/NodeGraph`
- Qt 5.15.3 (system-installed)
- libxml2 via FetchContent

## Important Technical Notes

### Cast-Free Architecture
All code uses metadata keys for type identification:
```cpp
setData(Gik::KindKey, Gik::Kind_Node);  // or Kind_Edge, Kind_Socket
setData(Gik::UuidKey, m_id.toString(QUuid::WithoutBraces));
```

### UUID Metadata Pattern (NOW FIXED)
Anywhere `m_id` is reassigned after initial construction MUST update metadata:
```cpp
m_id = QUuid(...);
setData(Gik::UuidKey, m_id.toString(QUuid::WithoutBraces));
```

### Socket Selectability (NOW FIXED)
- Nodes: `ItemIsSelectable = true` ✅
- Edges: `ItemIsSelectable = true` ✅
- Sockets: `ItemIsSelectable = false` ✅ (FIXED)

## Test Results

### Complete Graph Script
- ✅ All 5 node types created
- ✅ 6 nodes, 6 edges generated
- ✅ All 12 sockets connected (0 empty)
- ✅ XML save/load round-trip successful
- ✅ GUI repositioning and re-save works

### Node Deletion (FIXED)
- ✅ Nodes can now be deleted
- ✅ Connected edges auto-delete
- ✅ Logs show correct UUID lookup

## Known Issues

None currently - all reported issues fixed in this session.

## Commands to Resume

When you restart:

```bash
# Check current status
git status
git log --oneline -5

# Complete the merge (from main branch)

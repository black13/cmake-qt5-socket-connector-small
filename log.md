# Development Log - Qt5 Node Graph Editor

## 2025-01-15 - Architectural Analysis & Development Plan

### Overview
Conducted comprehensive architectural analysis of the Qt5/C++ node graph editor codebase, identified key strengths and critical issues, and developed a phased implementation plan for JavaScript integration and architectural improvements.

### Architectural Assessment

#### Strengths Identified ✅
- **Clean Separation**: Deliberate avoidance of QObject inheritance for graphics items prevents "zombie reference" problems with signal/slot connections
- **Performance**: O(1) UUID lookups via `QHash<QUuid, Node*>` and O(degree) edge updates via `QSet<Edge*> m_incidentEdges`
- **XML-First Design**: Self-serializing objects create consistent persistence model through `write()/read()` methods
- **Typed Scene Management**: Professional QElectroTech-style collections with UUID keys avoid casting and searching

#### Critical Issues Identified ⚠️

1. **JavaScript Integration State**
   - Comprehensive JavaScript infrastructure exists but conditionally compiled (`#if ENABLE_JS`)
   - Creates maintenance burden and unclear deployment story
   - Solution: Hide conditional compilation behind stable `ScriptEngine` facade

2. **Template System Status** 
   - Code correctly uses `NodeTypeTemplates::hasNodeType()` (no regression found)
   - Architecture.md documentation was outdated regarding this issue
   - Validation: Data-driven approach is properly implemented

3. **Edge Selection Logic Bug**
   - `Edge::itemChange()` has incorrect selection state logging
   - `bool wasSelected = isSelected()` captures new state, not old state
   - Fix: Capture `willBeSelected = value.toBool()` and infer `wasSelected = !willBeSelected`

4. **Raw Pointer Management**
   - Edge uses "manual weak pointers" (`Node*/Socket*`) with destruction callbacks
   - Fragile contract relying on `Node::~Node()` calling `Edge::invalidateNode()`
   - Mitigation: Enforce contract with assertions, consider `TrackedPtr<T>` wrapper

5. **Performance Micro-Issues**
   - QPen construction per frame in `Edge::paint()`
   - Inconsistent pick radius between `shape()` and `boundingRect()`
   - Self-deletion during key events could cause re-entrancy issues

### Development Plan

#### Phase 1: Stabilization (Weeks 1-2)
- **Branch 1: foundation-fixes** - Fix critical issues, establish clean foundation
- **Branch 2: template-system-fix** - Ensure data-driven validation is sole authority  
- **Branch 3: script-engine-facade** - Hide conditional compilation behind stable interface

#### Phase 2: Architecture (Weeks 3-4)
- **Branch 4: model-view-separation** - Separate data model from graphics representation
  - Create `ModelGraph`, `ModelNode`, `ModelEdge` classes
  - Graphics items hold UUIDs only, query model for data
  - Enable headless testing and script execution

#### Phase 3: Features (Weeks 5-7)
- **Branch 5: javascript-integration** - Add script execution to nodes
- **Branch 6: ui-integration** - Script editor and management UI

#### Phase 4: Production (Weeks 8-9)  
- **Branch 7: performance-optimization** - Caching, batch execution, profiling
- **Branch 8: testing-framework** - Comprehensive testing and CI/CD

### JavaScript Integration Strategy

#### Recommended Architecture
```cpp
// Stable facade - no conditional compilation at call sites
class ScriptEngine {
public:
    virtual ScriptResult executeNodeBehavior(const QString& script, 
                                             const QVariantMap& inputs) = 0;
};

// Two implementations: RealScriptEngine / NullScriptEngine
class RealScriptEngine : public ScriptEngine { /* QJSEngine wrapper */ };
class NullScriptEngine : public ScriptEngine { /* No-op stub */ };
```

#### Model-View Separation
- **ModelNode**: Stores script text, metadata (hash, version), properties
- **QGraphicsItem**: Holds UUID only, queries model for display data
- **DataFlow**: Topological execution through model graph, not graphics scene

#### Security Considerations
- Sandbox JavaScript execution (whitelist host API)
- Cooperative cancellation with time/step budgets
- Store scripts as `<![CDATA[...]]>` with hash validation

### Technical Decisions

#### Keep Graphics Items Non-QObject
- **Rationale**: Avoids Qt lifetime issues and signal/slot complexity in scene graph
- **Approach**: Centralize event handling at Scene/View level with observer pattern
- **Benefit**: Clean separation, better performance, easier testing

#### XML-First Persistence
- **Maintain**: All objects serialize themselves via `write()/read()` methods
- **Extend**: Add `<script>` tags with metadata (language, version, hash)
- **Validate**: Hash checking to detect external script modifications

#### Performance Priorities
- **Preserve**: O(1) UUID lookups, O(degree) edge updates
- **Optimize**: QPen caching, batch notifications, lazy evaluation
- **Monitor**: Memory usage, script execution time, layout performance

### JavaScript Archive
- **Action**: Created `javascript-archive` branch with 22 JavaScript test files
- **Location**: `origin/javascript-archive` (3,507 lines of archived code)
- **Reason**: Clean up main branch while preserving test infrastructure
- **Recovery**: Files can be restored from archive branch if needed

### Current Status
- **Branch**: `foundation-fixes` created and active
- **Next**: Begin implementing foundation fixes as per development plan
- **Risk**: Low - surgical improvements to establish clean development foundation

### Key Insights

1. **Architecture is Sound**: Core design decisions (UUID registries, XML-first, non-QObject graphics) are well-founded
2. **JavaScript Infrastructure Exists**: Comprehensive system already built, just needs clean activation
3. **Model-View Separation Critical**: Essential for testing, security, and maintainability
4. **Incremental Approach**: Phased development minimizes risk while delivering value
